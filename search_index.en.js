As an example, to get a Customer by its id from a customer microservice:\nyab customer Customer::get \\\n    -t /path/to/idl/some.company/customer/customer.thrift \\\n    -P 131.144.23.5/customer:tchannel \\\n    -r '{\"request\": {\"id\": 11}}'\n\nThe call is pretty convoluted, but it can be simplified by storing params in a yaml file:\n# customer_by_id.yaml\nservice: customer\nprocedure: \"Customer::get\"\nthrift: /path/to/idl/some.company/customer/customer.thrift\npeer-list: 131.144.23.5/customer:tchannel\nrequest:\n  request:\n    id: ${number:11}\n\nThe file takes a set of CLI flags in their long form, e.g. --thrift instead of -t, and their associated values.\nThen, the following call is equivalent to the beforementioned one:\nyab -y customer_by_id.yaml\n\nAdditional flags can be passed to yab to override the default values specified in the yaml file:\nyab -y customer_by_id.yaml --number 42\n\nI think this is pretty cool!\nIt can save us lots of time. It also helps sharing knowledge between team members: we could have a git repo with a bunch of these .yaml files and a simple git pull would allow everyone to be on the same page.\nMy immediate thought was \"could we easily replicate this for other commands?\"\nSolution\nFor the sake of simplicity, let's try to write a complex httpie command. It could be an involved awk, grep or jq command, though.\nThe final call should look like this:\nhttp -v POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts title=foo body=bar userId=11\n\nThe tool I'm going to use is navi. It allows you to browse through cheatsheets —that you may write yourself or download from maintainers— and execute commands. \nnavi encourages you to write .cheat files which break commands down into smaller, reusable pieces:\n% httpie\n\n# make a request to a typicode microservice\nhttp -v &lt;method&gt; \"https://&lt;service&gt;.typicode.com/&lt;endpoint&gt;\" &lt;http-body&gt;\n\n$ method: echo -e 'GET\\nPOST\\nPUT'\n$ service: echo -e 'jsonplaceholder\\nanotherservice'\n$ endpoint: case \"${service}:${method}\" in; \"jsonplaceholder:post\") echo -e 'e1\\ne2\\ne3';; esac\n\nThe endpoint values here are incomplete for briefness and, in a real-world scenario, would probably be fetched dynamically, instead of being harcoded.\nThis .cheat enables us to very quickly make a request to any endpoint in our company, given that we somehow mapped all possible values to the corresponding variables. \nBut an engineer who recently joined the team still wouldn't know what service/endpoint to request for creating a new post. We could then add another cheatsheet entry for more granular commands:\n% httpie, endpoints\n\n# create a post\nhttp -v &lt;method&gt; \"https://&lt;service&gt;.typicode.com/&lt;endpoint&gt;\" title=&lt;title&gt; body=&lt;body&gt; userId=&lt;userId&gt;\n\n$ method: echo 'POST'\n$ service: echo 'jsonplaceholder'\n$ endpoint: echo 'posts'\n$ title: echo 'foo'\n$ body: echo 'bar'\n$ userId: echo '11'\n\nThere are a multitude of ways to invoke this cheatsheet. One of them is like this:\n\nPreventing user interaction\nIf no interaction is wanted we could override values using environment variables and autoselect the desired command by using the --best-match flag:\nuserId=12 navi --query 'http endpoints create post' --best-match\n\nLet's say that we want to skip the --query and --best-match boilerplate and we know that we're always gonna use this tool for http endpoints. A simple bash script  come to the rescue:\nexport_var() {\n   local -r var=\"${1//-/_}\"\n   export \"$var\"=\"$2\"\n}\n\nendpoint() {\n   local var\n   for v in $@; do\n    case $v in\n        --*) var=\"${v:2}\" ;;\n        *) export_var \"$var\" \"$v\" ;;\n    esac\n   done\n\n   navi --query \"http endpoints ${query}\" --best-match\n}\n\nAnd we could call it as follows:\nendpoint 'create post'\nendpoint 'create post' --userId 12\nConclusion\nI hope that, with these tips, using the terminal becomes easier for you. \nCreating templates may speed up day-to-day tasks and improve knowledge sharing —either with other team members or with your future self.\nBy the way, if you have any feature requests for navi, feel free to leave an issue here!\n","id":"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/cli-templates/","title":"Creating templates for CLIs"},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/clojure-graalvm-shell-scripting/":{"body":"\n\n    \n\n    \n    Part of a shell script written in&nbsp;Clojure\n    \n\n    \n\n\nMotivation\nObjective: develop a shell script to ease the writing of XML files.\nLet’s say that the output to be generated is:\n&lt;grid&gt;   \n  &lt;row&gt;   \n     &lt;label id=\"info\" /&gt;   \n     &lt;text&gt;Now playing&lt;/text&gt;   \n  &lt;/row&gt;   \n  &lt;row&gt;   \n     &lt;button onTap=\"mute\" /&gt;   \n  &lt;/row&gt;   \n&lt;/grid&gt;\n\nI’d like to write it as:\n[:grid [:row [:label {:id :info}]   \n             [:text \"Now playing\"]]   \n       [:row [:button :onTap \"mute\"]]]\n\nBy the way, this syntax is a subset of EDN and called hiccup, used by frameworks such as re-frame.\nThis way, in my dotfiles, I can store, versionate and compose my configs as hiccup files and not as XML ones.\nThis is no simple task for Bash and would feel natural to use Clojure(Script).\nUsing Clojurescript\nUntil some months ago, I would write this script using lumo, a cross-platform, standalone ClojureScript environment.\nIt runs on Node.js and the V8 JavaScript engine. Also, the scripts are relatively fast: a “hello world” takes ~1s to run without caching on my machine; with caching enabled, ~0.3s.\nYou can find example scripts and helpers for lumo here.\nUsing Clojure\nWith the advent of Clojure CLI I stopped using lumo and I’m simply using the clj command now.\nMigrating from lumo to clj is trivial and gives us more features, such as better support for macros and multithreading.\nI’m using tools.deps for dependency graph expansion and using lein-tools-deps for leiningen compatibility.\nThe downside is the startup time: a simple “hello world” takes around ~2.5s and my XML→hiccup script, which depends on some libraries, needs more than 3s to finish.\nThis is fine for one-time only scripts but if I call a clj script in a Bash for-loop I’ll probably want to grab some coffee while it runs.\nSpeeding up with&nbsp;GraalVM\nGraalVM is a universal virtual machine for running applications written in JavaScript, Ruby, JVM-based languages and more.\nBy using AOT compilation we can compile our clj scripts to native code, which doesn’t rely on the JVM. The benefit? Let’s compare startup times:\nλ echo '[:table]' | time clj -m xml \n&lt;table /&gt; \nclj -m xml 9.88s user 0.68s system 293% cpu 3.593 total \n\nλ echo '[:table]' | time native-binary \n&lt;table /&gt; \nnative-binary 0.01s user 0.01s system 79% cpu 0.019 total\n\nThat’s 200x faster!\nIn addition, I can simply copy/paste this binary to any other machine with the same architecture + OS and it will work regardless of JVM or Node.js being installed or not.\nExample scripts and helpers for clj and GraalVM can be found here.\nFor other people’s experiences, click here or there.\n\n\n    This post first appeared on\n    Medium.\n\n\n","id":"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/clojure-graalvm-shell-scripting/","title":"Using Clojure + GraalVM for shell scripting"},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/data-driven-programming/":{"body":"\n\n    \n\n    \n    Photo by\n        aaronburden\n        on&nbsp;Unsplash \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\nIf there’s one thing that functional programming has taught me is the importance of values.\nSay we’re part of a startup’s founding team and are responsible for designing and building the core of its backend services. At its core, our job is to extract, transform and load values.\nIn general, the backend services must:\n\nreceive values from the mobile app. e.g., a JSON payload in a REST endpoint\nperform pure logic over values. e.g., apply f(balance, purchase) → new_balance\npersist values in the database\nand so on\n\nEverything else is overhead. Getters and setters, Gang of Four patterns and whatnot. Sure, these abstractions may allow you to scale code or team sizes. But they are overhead, still. They’re neither inherently part of our startup’s business model nor the reason the CEO decided to hire us.\nI guess that this philosophy behind values as first-class citizens led to the code as data movement. Or data-driven programming. Think of DSLs and configuration files. If we want to change our app’s behavior, there’s no need to launch IntellijJ and dive into the code: we can fiddle with some JSON-like file using a notepad app. The code parses it and acts accordingly. Profit.\nThe benefits of such approach are undeniable, but they introduce new problems. The main ones, that I’m gonna cover in this post, are:\n\nentry barrier\nno type-safety\n\nLet’s take a Kubernetes config as an example:\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    Is this code correct? Is there a typo? Should containers be a direct child of spec or selector? I know that ports has a containerPort field, but does it have any other one? If so, is it a string or a number?\n\n\nThe entry barrier is the time we need to take to understand this syntax. It’s a new language, in some sense. It’s good, old YAML but there are rules we need to understand prior to reading or writing such pieces of text.\nBy no type-safety I mean all the goodies we lose that we otherwise would have in an IDE for a strongly typed language. Autocomplete, Intellisense and references to previously declared values.\nFor Kubernetes I bet there are 3761 tools to make your life easier. But what about the DSLs we create?\nTo illustrate, let’s suppose our job is to create a DSL/config file for a backend-driven UI framework. i.e., we want to develop a system that allows front-end applications with screens and flows to be built based on backend responses. Spotify does that, by the way.\nWith this system, we theoretically only need one person to know the inner machinery of this code. But if a new intern wants to build a new screen, how will she know what to write in our DSL, in the first place?\nCreating an editor&nbsp;UI\nThis is in my opinion the best approach. We could have a web editor with drag-and-drop elements, drop-downs and even a live preview window that shows us how the final result would be.\nDiscoverability is addressed by these UI elements that pop in front of us. Correctness is guaranteed by the UI itself — by preventing us from clicking on stuff that would result into an invalid file.\nBut this has some cons:\n\nit’s expensive to write — in terms of time, at least\nit requires a full-stack team\nit doesn’t solve the problem with code review — in case the UI spits a file such as the Kubernetes one, the code review in general is limited to LGTM or 🙈, as in I trust that you used the UI correctly and I trust that the UI is correct.\n\nMaking use of our&nbsp;IDEs\nWhat if we wrote a plugin to VSCode, for example, that somehow helps other developers write our DSLs? But wait, we’re already using a popular format such as JSON or YAML. We could instead write a plugin that helps users write JSONs that follows some convention.\nBut there are millions of other developers out there. I bet someone has already thought about this and took the time to do exactly what we want. I’m lazy and our job in the startup is to persist values in the database and whatnot. I, for one, don’t want to focus efforts into this.\nIt turns out a solution does exist out there. The first page for the Google search typed YAML led me to strictyaml, which led me to JSON Schema.\nBy using a battle-tested solution we get everything for free plus support for all major IDEs.\nThere are a lot of articles on the Internet about the benefits and capabilities of JSON Schema, so I won’t bother you with details. I’ll simply demonstrate it with a GIF:\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    The intern has just joined the company, but she already knows that someone, at some point in time, wrote a billing_address widget.\n    \n\n\nThe schema used in this demo was extracted from react-jsonschema-form.\nI know that having a popup window when we type sounds like a small benefit but, if you stop to think about it, the intern didn’t even have to leave the file buffer! She didn’t need to browse through the code implementation, or read documents — that are likely outdated or incomplete — or contact the people that contributed to the DSL.\nThere are ways to extend this to YAML as well.\nOh, one suggestion: don’t write your JSON Schema and your code structs/classes by hand. Let one generate the other so that there’s a single source of truth.\nUsing data as code (as&nbsp;data)\nThe cool thing about having a DSL inside a JSON file is that in general it is parseable at runtime: we don’t need to deploy a new server instance and stop the previous one. We can curl -d \"@config.json\" -XPOST localhost:3000/apply to update the app's behavior.\nBut if we don’t need such dynamism — if e.g. in order to update this config file we need to open a PR in the same repository as the code, which leads to a new image build — then why not stay inside the code realm?\nWe’ll need to refactor packages a little bit so that, by convention, a given set of files will be considered as data, in contrast to implementation detail code. It seems like a small price to pay, though.\nIn Kotlin it would be straightforward to come up with a file such as this one:\n\n    \n    \n\n    In IntelliJ, if you typed BillingAddress, an Intellisense window would show us all possible fields. If we forgot the street field, the editor would suggest us to add it.\n\nThis is exactly what Anko does in order to build Android UIs, for example.\nChances are that — assuming we wrote this in Kotlin — we have other developers in the company already familiar with Kotlin, so they will feel at home with this syntax. No extra level of indirection introduced.\n\n\n    This post first appeared on\n    Medium.\n\n\n","id":"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/data-driven-programming/","title":"On data-driven programming"},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/dictionaries-in-shell-scripts/":{"body":"Sometimes you need to script in bash.

If you’re somewhat familiar with the stack I’ve used, hopefully there will be something useful for you to learn or to base on. It will be fast paced.\nObjective\nTo develop an investment tracker with the following requirements:\n\neverything must be determined by a plain-text file;\nthe only recurring input needed is sparse balance data;\nit must infer data as good as possible;\nit must maintain historic data;\nit must draw beautiful visualizations.\n\nIn other words, if I write down today the balance of some investments of mine, and 1 month from now I write down the balance of other investments, the system should be able to interpolate data so that it can plot smooth, realistic curves.\nThis is different from a ledger system, for which there are plenty of open source solutions.\nIt could be done with some Excel wizardry, I suppose. But I didn’t want to learn that much of Excel.\nFile syntax\nI’ve decided to use the edn format, because I was determined to code the system in Clojure. Here is some simplified, mock data:\n\n    \n\nIt has as little information as possible yet it still is human-readable. Nice!\nInternalizing data\nThe first step was to convert the file contents to internal models with namespaced keys. In particular, I converted date strings to a numeric format so that I could apply traditional math over it. After some maps and reduces, we have a collection of elements such as:\n\n    \n\nInitially, I had written functions for integrals, derivatives, curve aggregation and so on. But I was reinventing the wheel. Now, I’m leveraging the robustness of time-series ecosystems.\nThe competitors were Prometheus, InfluxDB and Graphite. As of the time of writing, there’s no way to fetch past data into Prometheus. InfluxDB has too much SQL for my taste. Graphite was the chosen one, then.\nWith a simple pure function, we can export our internal models as Graphite-compatible data:\ncitigroup.rf.cdb_paribas 1554325794 1000.00\ncitigroup.rf.cdb_paribas 1554378794 1050.33\ncitigroup.rf.cdb_paribas 1564325312 1097.44\n\nNow we can perform queries such as sumSeries(some.bucket.*), instead of hand crafting it directly in our code.\nVisualizing balances\nGraphite has a built-in renderer for data:\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    This is really&nbsp;ugly\n    \n\n    \n\n\nBut we aren’t in the 90s anymore. I wanted to use something easier on the eyes: Grafana.\nFortunately, Grafana works out of the box with Graphite, so it was a piece of cake to build beautiful dashboards:\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    The main dashboard\n    \n\n    \n\n\nTabular and scalar&nbsp;data\nEven though piping data to Graphite made my life easier, it limited possibilities. There’s no simple way to display in a table all the info for yielding investments. Or adding a single stat with the next investment maturity date.\nIt became clear I had to add a second data source. Considering that some steps before I already had all the data in Clojure code, I decided to upgrade the Clojure scripts to an HTTP server.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    InfluxDB can’t provide this tabular&nbsp;data\n    \n\n    \n\n\nGrafana has support for JSON APIs as data source. Its serialization format is different from Graphite’s but I only had to write yet another pure, adapter function to get a result like this:\n\n    \n\nExtras\nAfter finishing all the groundwork, it became easy peasy to add new features, such as consuming external APIs for displaying stock values or currency history, to name a few.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    Currencies and stock information scraped from third-party APIs\n    \n\n    \n\n\nThis is a complete edn file specifying what currencies and stocks we should keep track of.\nDeploying\nThe easiest way to install Grafana on OSX is to use brew. Then you run brew service start and have to remember to stop it because the service persists even after a reboot. Then there's Graphite and Clojure.\nMaybe there’s a better way to do it but I rage quit it and started using docker for everything instead.\nBy mounting volumes, we can start Grafana pre-configured with the default data sources and dashboards in a such way that we don’t have to set it up manually everytime.\nAdapting it to your&nbsp;needs\nThe code is available on Github for you to fork. It’s a little bit oriented to my needs and the Brazilian financial system. However, smalls adjustments should be enough to adapt it.\nConclusion\nI’m very happy with the result because I was able to develop it quickly, without having to learn new tools. The way the namespaces and models are organized facilitates swapping backends or splitting the code into microservices, if the future demands it.\n\n\n    This post first appeared on\n    Medium.\n\n\n","id":"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/grafana-personal-finance/","title":"Using Grafana for personal financial management"},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/microservice-splitting-code-refactoring/":{"body":"\n\n    \n\n    \n    Photo by\n        leliejens\n        on&nbsp;Unsplash \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\nLet’s say that you work for a company that offers a platform for personal finance management. You were requested to add a feature whose input from the customer is a list of company × amount of stocks × investment date and the output is the customer’s total balance for a given point in time.\nHow big or small should the microservice(s) be?\nAt one end of the spectrum, you have a single monolith, with scalability issues.\nAt the other end, you have one service for:\n\nstock value scraping (stockScraper)\ncompany info store (companyStore)\nstock value history store (stockHistory)\ncustomer input stock store (stockStore)\n\nThis approach gives us a nice separation of concerns and makes it easy to develop and scale each part independently. However, it takes more time to have an MVP this way, and time to market may be crucial. And it costs more, as well, because of overheads (such as multiple JVMs, databases, message streaming, etc).\nGiven your resource constraints, maybe it makes sense to start as a single service (newFeature). But what if you want or need to split it later?\nHere are my tips for designing a service easy to refactor, at a low cost during development.\n0. Divide your application into&nbsp;layers\nYou can choose from onion, layered, and hexagonal architectures, among others. As always, prioritize immutability, state management, pure logic extraction and all the other best practices.\n1. Don’t be afraid of using many namespaces\nDon’t keep all namespaces (packages, files) centralized in a root one. Instead of newFeature.logic.stockScraper, use stockScraper.logic. Have you created a pure function that may be useful for both stockScraper and stockStore? Put it inside stock.logic. Have you written a function for linear interpolation? This math concept isn't restricted to a specific feature so it doesn't have to be inside newFeature.logic.math, for example. Put it inside common.math. This way you aren't tempted to put linearInterpolate and stockSum in the same file.\nWhen the time comes for service splitting, you can deploy the common and stock folders as libraries and start the stockScraper service by cut and pasting the respective folder. Much easier than traversing all the codebase later to extract everything you need!\n2. Import non-common namespaces with&nbsp;care\nDoes stockHistory have to import stockScraper a lot? Can't it be minimized? Remember that when splitting this will translate into HTTP calls or message streaming. Try to at least isolate this dependency into a single namespace, which will be the precursor of the API between the two. This step is the most subjective, because it can quickly introduce overheads in the codebase for an MVP. You must consider the trade-offs.\n3. Isolate implementation details into higher level components\nLet’s now implement the handler for the endpoint that returns information about all the companies a customer has stocks from. One common approach is the following (we’re exposing components via dependency injection and middlewares):\n\n    \n\nAfter splitting our service, not all data will be available via the db argument, of course. We'll need to make some HTTP calls. customerCompaniesHandler will have to get an HTTP component and pass it to getCustomerCompanies, which will propagate it to the domain-specific helper functions and so on...\nBut why does the handler have to know this in the first place? We have divided our application into layers and, more importantly, we have already separated our code into companyStore, stockStore and other namespaces. Yet, we clearly have an implementation detail leak such that all our higher level, integration API code has to know about low level dependency management. These layers should be agnostic to where we store the company entity...\nIdeally, our handler should only know that it has to fetch data that depends on the stock and company entities. What if we created a component that abstracts this away, per entity? Let's call one of them as CompanyRepository (you can come up with the name you like):\n\n    \n\nYou can skip the interface/protocol definition if you’re not into that. The important thing is to avoid leaking lower level components.\nAfter adding this component to our dependency graph, our code would become:\n\n    \n\nFor the service split, we could create:\n\n    \n\nThe only thing we need to do is update the dependency graph! All the rest of the code remains the same.\nAs a plus, we can move CompanyDbRepository to companyStore. Code reuse!\nWrap up\nSuppose you’re absolutely certain that you won’t have to split your recently created microservice or that the process will be easy enough such that you won’t curse your past self. Then, you may not see much value in my article.\nHowever, this isn’t just about spatial organization or isolation. It’s about making domains arguably easier to reason about. Establishing higher level boundaries reduces the cognitive requirement to fiddle with a codebase. You only need to traverse the code as deep as required. I find it easier to handle new abstractions than reaching a mental stack overflow when browsing lines of code.\nAnd even if you decide to keep a single service, it’s much easier for a newcomer to improve stockParser, for example, if he or she only has to read a root namespace and not the whole microservice code.\nAnyway, no one is able to perfectly measure the ideal microservice size, because that varies in time, the company size, the feature success and many other factors. So it’s nice to be flexible.\nClojure sidenotes\n\nDuct follows this pattern and calls it boundary.\nYou can skip the component creation altogether and define boundaries with resolvers using a library such as Pathom: you define a graph edge that enables you to go from a customerId to a company, for example.\n\nFront-end sidenote\nEven though I focused on the back-end, this applies to front-end as well. Why make the CompanyDetailsPage receive an HTTP component and perform a request? It can simply receive a CompanyRepository and you can call repository.getDetails().\n\n\n    This post first appeared on\n    Medium.\n\n\n","id":"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/microservice-splitting-code-refactoring/","title":"On microservice splitting and code refactoring"},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/mind-maps/":{"body":"Since high school I've never had a paper notebook.

I can't memorize these chunks of text and, if I want to dive deep into a subject, I'm much better off reading text books or browsing Wikipedia articles. \nIn fact, I've never trusted my own notes. Maybe I got it wrong in the first place. Maybe the way I wrote is ambiguous. Ultimately, the bigger the notes, more likely they can lead me to wrong conclusions. \nThe need\nHowever, sometimes I want to refresh my memory on a particular subject and reading books and articles is too time consuming. I just want to recap the absolute essential — things I shouldn't forget. Some minimal notes surely would come in handy. \nI researched for cheap yet effective note taking methods. I tried Cornell notes but they didn't do the trick for me. Then I tried mind maps and I really liked it. \n\n    \n    A typical mind map. Source: mindmapping.com\n\nWhat I fancy about mind maps is that they are extremely minimalist and favor connection of ideas. It's also possible to adjust the level of details you want to write/read by determining how deep into the nodes you want to dive. \nFirst experience\nThe first time I used mind maps for real was when I was studying for a software engineering interview in a big tech company. \nFor an Algorithm question in general you need to know beforehand what's the better strategy for solving it. Should it use a graph? Or a linked list? When faced with such a problem it isn't trivial to know how to solve it but if you ask yourself \"would graphs work here?\" you generally have an immediate yes/no. A mind map —either in paper or in your brain— with all the possibilities makes things much easier. \nThe objective\nAfter the good experience I had with mind maps, I decided to digitally register part of my knowledge using this method. Not only about algorithms but also Biology, History, Grammar and all these other fields I barely know a thing. \nI established some criteria. The tool for this job should:\n\nhave a very low time-wise cost for writing \nhave basic search functionality\nhave a way to connect different mind maps \nbe portable — it should work at least on my PC and my phone\n\nI didn't find any tool that fits these criteria, so I decided to build my own. That said, one additional requirement was:\n\nthe tool should be so simple that the time to build it should be at most a few hours — because I'm lazy\n\nThis requirement made me reject some complex ideas I had that involved graph databases such as Neo4j.\nFor writing, I went with the most simple solution possible: an indented plain text document. \nKingdoms\n   Animalia\n   Plantae\n   Arthropoda\n      Insects\n   Fungi\n   Porifera\nThe result\nAfter some work, here's what I came up with:\n\n    \n    Jumping between nodes and different mind maps is easy!\n\nThe UI is smart enough to show any relevant info related to the root node, so the more mind maps you write that include the query, the more data the UI will be able to connect. \nSince it uses pretty standard web technologies, it works on my phone without any hiccups. \n\n    \n    The UI is fully functional on Chromium-based browsers on Android\n\nI also added buttons to quickly go the dictionary definition or Wikipedia article related to the root node. \n\n    \n    Clicking on the globe icon leads to the Wikipedia article that best matches \"gauss\"\n\nIt's hosted on Github Pages so you can try it out here. \nThe app is capable of downloading mind map definitions from the web so it should work for everyone. Please refer to help section for more info.\nDo you have suggestions for this tool? If so please open an issue in its git repo! \n","id":"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/mind-maps/","title":"Mind maps"},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/monolithic-apps-graph-apis/":{"body":"\n\n    \n\n    \n    Honeycombs have many cells but they act together to fulfill the same purpose by\n        matthew_t_rader\n        on&nbsp;Unsplash \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\nLast year, I talked about monolithic architecture that enables easy microservice splitting later.\nAfter applying it for a large codebase, I’ve started using another approach: graph APIs.\nRecap\nIn a nutshell, I believe it’s fundamental to isolate different parts of an application into different modules, even if they are deployed as a single monolith at the end of the day.\nLimiting the required cognitive load to navigate the code base is a must.\nWriting scalable and readable code in the first shot is tough. If you have time and effort constraints (as I have for personal projects: I don’t want to spend hundreds of hours developing them), it’s even harder.\nUnreadable, difficult to maintain code is a red flag. But if it works, is isolated and no one needs to look at it anymore, it’s less bad. Sure, one day it will stop working or will need to be updated, but until then people will have better context and know what works and what doesn’t. If it’s contained, it may even be plausible to rewrite it from scratch without huge costs.\nPast proposal\nIn my past article I proposed this isolation via interfaces/objects/providers. I’ve been using it in my personal financial platform and it has been great!\nI needed to change the provider for stock historical value and I only had to look at a single package, because there was no implementation details leakage to other parts of the code. Even if the codebase had 1MM LOC for all sorts of features, I knew that I (or anyone else) would only need to look at, and try to understand, ~50 LOC.\nHowever, using these providers has some downsides:\nIt’s relatively too&nbsp;verbose\nOne module of mine only had pure functions, summing up ~20 LOC. However, in order to isolate it, I had to create a [defprotocol](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/defprotocol), a [defrecord](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/defrecord), implement some lifecycle and so on, even though it was stateless.\nThe interfaces don’t scale&nbsp;well\nHaving a defprotocol with get-stocks and get-stock-history is fine. But when you start pushing it towards get-new-stocks-with-high-volatility, things can get out of control.\nExplicit dependencies\nI wanted to get the historical value of all the investments available at my bank. One module was able to fetch my bank and get the name of the investments. Another one, which queries another API, was able to convert the name to an ID. Finally, a third module was able to get the history given an ID.\nWhere to put this composition? I wanted to make things transparent (the fact that my bank doesn’t expose the IDs shouldn’t leak to outer modules), so I made the bank module depend on the second one.\nThat worked. But in another flow the second module relied on the bank one. If we’re not careful enough, circular dependency may happen. This interdependency is difficult to reason about.\nAnother solution is to have a higher-level module that knows everyone else. A sort of BFF/façade. That’s better, but it still needs to know that, e.g., the bank module doesn’t expose the IDs so and additional query is needed.\nNew approach\nWhat if we could have looser dependencies? What if no one needed to know how to surgically compose different modules to deliver a single response? With Graph APIs we can.\nFor Clojure, you can use the awesome Pathom library, which will do all the heavy work for you.\nTo implement my example, the bank module could register a resolver like the one below (I’m stripping away some boilerplate for readability):\n\n    \n\nFor the second module:\n\n    \n\nFinally, for the last module:\n\n    \n\nI now have a decentralized system. The graph parser knows by itself that, for each element in&nbsp;:bank/investments, it needs to go from&nbsp;:investment/name to&nbsp;:investment/id then&nbsp;:investment/history and how to resolve it.\nAs for the namespace organization, each module has the following structure:\n\n    \n\n\nlogic/ contains pure functions\nhttp/ and db/ are one of many ports in the hexagonal architecture\ngraph/ has the resolvers above\nwhen the resolvers get complicated, helper functions are extracted to controllers/, which orchestrate function calls\ndefinition.clj is a file I already had to bootstrap the server, but has now been extended to each module\n\nModule definition\nAn example of definition.clj:\n\n    \n\n\n:http and&nbsp;:bank have immutable data that can be propagated to other components\n:components has some dependency-injection declarations\n:entry-point is the function to be called in case this module is to be used standalone or as the routing hub\n\nFinally, I have a [defmethod](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/defmethod) that’s able to reduce a config vector into a final, single config. For&nbsp;:http, for example, it merges all the bookmarks; for&nbsp;:resolvers it concatenates all vectors; for&nbsp;:entry-point, it keeps the last one.\nIn the end, to start the system, I call:\n\n    \n\n(:entry-point rest-server.definition/config), for instance, is what spawns the server listening on port 80. If I want to use the system as a CLI, there's no need to spawn the server and curl it. I could simply swap the last config with cli.definition/config.\nSplitting into microservices/libraries\nIf for any reason the need arises, deploying a module as a microservice is trivial from a code perspective.\nFor the new microservice:\n\nclone the monolith into a different repository\nremove all undesired modules\nedit the bootstrap-app! call accordingly\nexpose the resolvers it has (Pathom call this index)\n\nFor the original monolith:\n\nremove the module folder except definition.clj\nchange definition.clj in such a way that the monolith is able to merge its index with the one in the new microservice (Pathom allows merging indexes as well)\n\nSteps for extracting a module to a library would be very similar (in case the module only has pure logic, for example).\nDownsides of the new&nbsp;approach\n\nfor my particular case, having the graph find out the edge traversal is perfectly fine, but if I wanted maximum performance, calling the functions directly could be faster and less resource intensive (pending benchmark, though)\nsince edges are loose, it’s difficult to find usages given a function or field. The IDE won't be able to know in what flows a resolver may be used\n\nConclusion\nThis has given my code huge scalability at low costs and I’m fine with the downsides I could think of.\nAt the moment I have no open-source code to show, but if you’re really interested, contact me and we can work something out.\nIf you’ve liked the ideas highlighted here regarding graph APIs, please check this talk from Pathom’s author.\n\n\n    This post first appeared on\n    Medium.\n\n\n","id":"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/monolithic-apps-graph-apis/","title":"Writing multi-module, monolithic apps with graph APIs"},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/moving-from-medium/":{"body":"I plan to stop posting on Medium and start posting on my own blog.\nIt uses zola under the hood and will allow me to write posts faster and with more features.\nHopefully I'll be able to post more frequently.\nThe website includes an RSS feed as well.\nAgain, if you want to check new posts, click here.\n\n\n    This post first appeared on\n    Medium.\n\n\n","id":"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/moving-from-medium/","title":"Moving from Medium"},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/react-native-kotlinjs/":{"body":"\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\nKotlin is an awesome language. It is functional and offers extension functions, null safety, smart casting, type-safe builders, default and named arguments, data classes and much more. It is arguably the language of choice for Android developers and very familiar to iOS developers.\nReact Native enables us to write only once for multiple platforms, has a simpler API than native development and a smooth learning curve. Steve Yegg, a former Google engineer, conjectures in his blog post that hybrid frameworks are likely to become even more popular. And the framework from Facebook is the major player at the moment.\nSo why not mixing both?&nbsp;\nStanding on the shoulder of giants (JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers and ScottPierce/kotlin-react-native), we can.&nbsp;\nAn example repository can be found here.\nReact in a&nbsp;nutshell\nYou can learn the basics of React Native very quickly reading the official tutorial, but three important takeaways are:\n\nview = f(state)&nbsp;\nReact has a virtual representation of the view, and it calculates the smallest diff between renders\ndevelopment should be component-driven\n\nHello world in&nbsp;Kotlin\nAfter cloning the example repository and following the README, you can simply edit the render() function to immediately see the result on the device.\nFor example, writing the following code…\n\n    \n\n…would render the following output:\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    Our first application with Kotlin and React&nbsp;Native\n    \n\n    \n\n\nThanks to the Kotlin language features, we can write the view using a builder DSL similar to JSX, instead of manually calling React.createElement(…, React.createElement(…)).\nCreating our first component\nLet’s say you have the following view architecture and you want to make the code for headers reusable:\n\n    \n\nFor this task, you could create a Header component:\n\n    \n\nAnd call it from the render() function as such:\n\n    \n\nAlternatively, if you want the extend the DSL so that you can call this component directly, just create an extension function:\n\n    \n\nManaging state\nReact doesn’t dictate how state management should be. For the sake of this example, let’s write our own simplified, naive implementation of Redux.\nIn this pattern, we have three main elements:\n\nstore: holds the state\nactions: describe the changes\nreducers: return an updated state based on the requested action\n\nHere is the full implementation:\n\n    \n\nEvidently, on a real world application, you should prevent race conditions and implement the subscriptions in an atomic fashion, possibly using RxJS. But that’s good for now.\nA less contrived example\nNow let’s write a simple application which consists of a header, and two rating widgets, for giving scores to two different programming languages.\nFirst we create the models:\n\n    \n\nThen the actions that can be dispatched:\n\n    \n\nLater on, we define the reducer:\n\n    \n\nThen we define a view model, mapping state to view abstractions:\n\n    \n\nWe connect everything with a store:\n\n    \n\nFinally, we create a stateless, dumb component:\n\n    \n\nAnd another component that keeps track of the state:\n\n    \n\nAnd the final result is:\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    Our final application\n    \n\n    \n\n\nSo… Is Kotlin with React Native production-ready?\nPossibly, but there are still some improvements to be made to the whole ecosystem. The interoperability with JavaScript isn’t effortless and has some pitfalls. For example, passing the store via props to the component won’t work because the state will become immutable. Also, using data classes for the props directly will return an error from React because apparently the serialization contains some metadata. In addition, you’re supposed to write your own type definitions, which is a huge productivity killer.\nI think JetBrains is to blame for the unpopularity of KotlinJS, by not giving the language the love it deserves. Kotlin/ts2kt, for instance, could solve the type definition problem. However, most of the attempts for converting types fail, and the issues remain open. Actually, we don’t see many examples targeting JS at all, despite the fact that this a working platform for more than a year. Maybe they are focused on Kotlin/Native…\nIn the meantime, another alternative to JavaScript is Clojurescript, which is awesome with re-frame and in my opinion offers the best development experience out there. However, it’s not for the faint-hearted.\nI hope that with this article and the example repository, the community can reconsider Kotlin as a language for React Native.

It lacked features and quickly became unmaintainable.\nI decided to build my own tool instead. I started with a React (Native) Clojurescript web/mobile app. I never finished it. \nI created a system using Clojure and Python, paired with Grafana. It worked pretty well, actually, but I never managed to deploy it in a free/cheap hosting service, because of JVM's and pandas' requirements.\nI converted the codebase to Rust as a pet project. The memory and processing footprints became negligible. Cool! \nBut every once in a while I need to perform a simple calculation on the data, or plot an ad-hoc graph, or explore something new. Cloning repositories, editing the source code and recompiling everything isn't fun. \nSpreadsheets are good at that. Ironically, I decided to go back to Google Sheets. But this time for real. \nArchitecture diagram\nHere's the diagram of the complete system:\n\n    \n \nI'll cover each section in more details.\nUsing Google Sheets for input\nOne of the requirements was that, as before, input should be minimal. In this case, it should basically be an event log of money transfers: \n\n    \n    The first 2 and last 2 columns are filled automatically\n\nAn extra sheet was necessary to completely define some investments. NASDAQ:APPL is all the input you need to define Apple's stock -- provided you get data externally --, but some fixed income investments have their own criteria -- e.g. rate of interest. \n\n    \n    This sheet only contains data which isn't possible to obtain otherwise\n \nUsing Google sheets for processing\nHandling input was the easy part. Fetching data from APIs and doing the math is complicated laborious.\nI can't get my head around =ARRAYFORMULA(IF..., VLOOKUP(...FILTER(...(INDEX...(MATCH...))))) formulae. Fortunately, Google Sheets allows using Javascript for manipulating sheets. It's not Rust my favorite language but at least it has .map(), .filter() and alike.\nAfter so many attempts building the same system, I came up with a mental model which I didn't want to abandon so I replicated it once again.\nTo implement a timeseries database, a single spreadsheet was used. The y-axis represents time; the x-axis, different vectors:\n\n    \n    This sheet contains all numeric data\n \nIn Javascript we can read from and write to this sheet as if we were using a real timeseries database. Effectively, this made my new code look very similar to the previous ones:\n// old \ninflux.emit(today, 3.12)\n// new\ntsdbSheet.setValue('D67') = 3.12\n \n// old \nconfig = readFromFile('./config.yaml')\nfoo = config.foo\n// new\nfoo = configSheet.getValue('A2')\nAbstractions\nThese low-level spreadsheet operations were abstracted away, in order to make the rest of the code agnostic to Google Sheets. Should I decide to port it elsewhere, I'll only need to edit some parts from the TSDB, EventLog and Config classes.\nFor example, calculating balances looks like this:\nconfig.assets.forEach(asset -&gt; {\n   const balance = range(startDate, today).map(date =&gt; {\n      const value = someMath(asset, date, tsdb)\n      return [date, value] \n   }\n   tsdb.save(asset.id, 'balance', balance)\n})\n\nGetting historical data for stocks isn't any different:\nconfig.assets\n   .filter(asset =&gt; asset.kind == 'stock') \n   .forEach(stock =&gt; {\n      const price = callSomeApi(asset.id)\n      tsdb.save(asset.id, 'price', price) \n   }) \n\nSimilarly, to prevent some input, the following is executed on startup:\nconfig.assets\n   .filter(asset -&gt; asset.reachedMaturity())\n   .forEach(asset -&gt; eventLog.save('sell', asset.id, asset.maturityDate))\n\nFinally, this allowed me to achieve what I already had in the early designs but with 3 benefits:\n\nI can access it from anywhere, as long as the device supports Google Sheets\nI edit tabular data, instead of a difficult-to-maintain .yml file versioned in a private Github repository\nI can quickly run an ad-hoc =SUM(FILTER(...))) against my data if necessary \n\nDashboards\nSpreadsheet formulae are cool but I still like looking at dashboards and plotting graphs on the fly, so I reused the architecture I already had on top of Grafana. I don't want to share screenshots here but the dashboard looks like any regular Grafana one:\n\n    \n    Grafana dashboards normally look like this\n \nFor example, I can quickly write a query to compare the portfolio performance against the Ibovespa index.\n\n    \n    To get the performance of assets broken down by broker, sum(...) by (broker) would do the trick\n \n(Real) timeseries database\nI decided to VictoriaMetrics this time. It's fast and it has support for a much needed feature: backfilling. In other words, I'm able to emit values for timestamps in the past. \nIts query engine is called MetricsQL and is a superset of PromQL. \nI'd like to highlight 3 features from MetricsQL:\n\n\nkeep_last_value: only one data point per day per series is emitted. Anything above this would be redundant, since I don't day trade. However, Grafana asks for n data points per day, n function of the width of the panel in pixels and is normally greater than 1. Without keep_last_value the plots would contain gaps. Summing metrics with gaps in different positions is erratic, because gaps are interpreted as 0.\n\n\nWITH statement: this lets query aliasing, which is pretty handy. By the way, if you like WITH too, you may like pipers. \n\n\nrange_first: with this function I was able to normalize investment performances so that they all start with 1, making comparisons a breeze, as seen above. \n\n\nExporting/importing data\nI added an Export button to Google Sheets which exports the contents from the spreadsheets to Grafana:\n\n    \n    It's easy to call custom scripts like this\n  \nIt simply serializes the in-memory data structures as JSON text and sends it in a POST request.\nNotes on performance\nThe Rust implementation was able to read the config file, make all requests in parallel, calculate everything and export all data to Grafana in ~5 seconds.\nI expected my first implementation in Google Sheets to be slower, or course. But I didn't expect it to be SO SLOW. The first implementation took 45~60min to finish processing. At least that's what I estimate, because I wasn't patient enough to wait for it. \nThe problem is that sheet.setValue(...) takes 500ms~3s for each cell. Also, switching between read and write modes takes about the same time. If you consider that each investment generates ~10 timeseries -- average price, balance, etc. -- and that each timeseries has 365 data points per year, then you'll see that this quickly explodes.\nThis reminded me of the problem that frameworks like React faced. Manipulating the DOM is slow, so they ended up creating a virtual representation of the DOM. I did the same, but for spreadsheets. It sounds complicated, but it isn't.\nBasically, tsdb.save(...) doesn't manipulate the sheet directly but mutates an in-memory data structure instead. Later on, it sets the values for ranges instead of cells, in batch. The \"public\" APIs remained the same -- only the implementation details changed.\nAfter these optimizations, the script takes less than a minute to complete.\nThis could be improved even further, but I don't want to make the code more complex just to save a few seconds once a month. \nResult\nTo be honest, it's likely that a couple of months years from now I'll decide to write everything from scratch yet again. \nIt's not you, project of mine. It's me. \nBut I'm sure of one thing: the system has never been so flexible and portable.\nCodebase\nThe spreadsheet and the source code are currently private because it would require some effort to make them shareable -- from privacy, security and usability standpoints. \nPlease reach out to me if you're interested in it, though. Maybe I can come up with something! 👍\nIn the meantime, I highly recommend dlombello's spreadsheets, which should fit most people's needs.\n","id":"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/spreadsheet-tsdb-finance/","title":"Using a spreadsheet as a timeseries database for finance"},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/tips-for-faster-development/":{"body":"\n\n    \n\n    \n    An hourglass with most of its sand on its bottom by\n        neonbrand\n        on&nbsp;Unsplash \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\nI’m lazy!\nWorking is satisfying but if I were to choose between, say, fixing broken integration tests vs watching Netflix, swimming or spending some quality time with my girlfriend, I would probably choose the latter.\nHowever, the job market is increasingly competitive. Companies expect you to deliver results as most as possible. In order to catch up with colleagues, employees tend to work until late at night. Impostor syndrome isn’t unusual. Even so, people are fired for performance reasons. There’s simply no space for not shipping at the end of the day.\nUnfortunately, as much as I don’t want to work 10h/day, it’s expected from me to get the job done. So what I try to do is to code the most I can during the hours I’m in the office.\nDo I know the secrets for productivity? Absolutely not!&nbsp;\nNevertheless, during these years I have developed production-ready code, my productivity has evolved a little bit.\nThe purpose of this post isn’t simply about showing what I learned. Instead, it’s about showing examples that will possibly trigger your mind so that you yourself can improve your workflow.\nIf after this post you save 15 minutes at the end of the day, my objective here will be accomplished.\nWithout further ado, let’s get started with the first tip!\nFile/folder navigation\nI think it’s fundamental to navigate around your file system.\nAs an exercise, let’s cd to a mobile app from work.&nbsp;\nThis is a simple, tedious and time-consuming way to do it.\ncd ~/dev/work/mobile\n\nCreating a simple alias function already saves us some keystrokes:\ncdw() { cd \"$HOME/dev/work/$1\"; }  \ncdw mobile\n\nBut we still can do much better. An improved version of this could be achieved using the fzf command. fzf is a fuzzy-finder that allows you to interactively choose an input from stdin. I use it for everything and folder browsing isn’t an exception.\n\n    \n\nSo, in a single command we get for free: listing, a nice interface and matching by substrings. We also added another arity to our command that _cd_s to the best match directly. Nice, isn’t it?\nA more generic approach would be using the fasd command. Fasd keeps track of every folder you cd into and scores them by frecency: a metric based on frequency and recency, so it knows where you probably wanna go to.\nThis way, if I have already visited the mobile folder, I can simply type ‘’mob’’ and I’m done.\n~/Downloads  \nλ j mob\n\n~/dev/work/mobile  \nλ\n\nFrom this, we can come up with a lot of interesting commands.\nUsing this command, for example, I can quickly open in vim any file that is inside any subfolder of the folder I’m currently in. Likewise, if I input a substring to it, it opens the best match directly.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    With simple scripts you don’t even need to launch a project in an IDE to quickly edit a&nbsp;file\n    \n\n    \n\n\nA nice addition is ranger, a file explorer for the terminal: we can quickly switch between folders, see previews and much more.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    Ranger displays multiple columns so that you can view parent folders as well as file&nbsp;contents\n    \n\n    \n\n\nFinally, I really recommend having an easy way to switch between the terminal and your OS’s explorer. Here, I’m using Alfred to open the current folder in Finder in the terminal.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    With Alfred, I can quickly launch a terminal window in the same folder as&nbsp;Finder\n    \n\n    \n\n\nGit\nThe most straightforward tip is to use shell aliases.\nSo, instead of typing the following…\ngit checkout master  \ngit pull  \ngit checkout feature  \ngit merge master  \ngit commit -a\n\n…we can save lots and lots of keystrokes (and time) by using:\ngcom  \ngl  \ngco -  \ngmm  \ngca\n\nAnother tip is to use a global&nbsp;.gitignore.\nThis way, you have the guarantee that you’ll never ever commit again node_modules, IDE files or sensitive data, regardless of your repository’s&nbsp;.gitignore.\nGit hooks are very powerful as well. They are scripts that are run before you commit or push, for example.\nHow many times have you committed a bad JSON, for example, then committed a “fix typo” immediately after? Git hooks for the rescue!\nSimply validate JSON files in a pre-commit hook: if anything is incorrect, the commit may be aborted.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    A git hook may prevent us from commiting bad&nbsp;code\n    \n\n    \n\n\nI also use this for other file syntax validation as well as for preventing me from committing sensitive data, such as AWS keys.\nWrite your own git helpers. This is how I git checkout:\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    Remember fzf? I’m using it to select available branches\n    \n\n    \n\n\nUsing git squash  really changed my daily work.\nFirst, let’s see what many people consider a nice, organized PR:\n6c96a Add logic  \n84f15 Replace login screen  \n7960c Add button callbacks to new login screen  \n22cd3 Add ...  \n6c96a Add unit tests  \n34fa5 Fix unit tests  \n12cd4 Bump  \nbc96a Merge branch master  \na3b5a Bump again\n\nFirst commit: ‘’Add logic’’. Fair enough.\nThen, “Replace login screen’’. Ok.\n‘’Add button callbacks to new login screen’’. Wait a minute! The previous commit was replacing a working screen by an incomplete one! Possibly it wouldn’t even compile. What good is this previous commit for, then?&nbsp;\nIf we were to git bisect these commits would only fool us.&nbsp;\nI think that the master branch should only have commits with which you would be fairly comfortable to have in prod.&nbsp;\n‘’Add unit tests’’. Was everything untested, then? The previous commits are potentially buggy code?\nYou see, we’ve put a lot of effort into carefully hand-picking chunks of code and writing commit messages with arguably no benefit. Rarely anyone reviews a PR commit by commit, anyway.\nIdeally, we could select chunks of code so that every commit has nice test coverage and the expected behavior. But that takes too much time. Instead, I do the following:\nbc96a wip  \n54be0 code compilable again  \nab4fc fixes\n\nWhen I open the PR I try to write a nice PR description. Finally, I simply squash everything into a single commit and merge it.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    Even though the commit messages aren’t helpful, the PR description should be enough to give the necessary context\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    GitHub offers a quick way to squash and&nbsp;merge\n    \n\n    \n\n\nIt’s time saving and we get a nice history for free, even on terminal!\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    By squashing, we don’t have useless&nbsp;commits\n    \n\n    \n\n\nShell scripting\nAnother fundamental skill to be efficient is to write shell scripts hassle-free.We studied programming and are usually hired to develop scalable, high-quality microservices or applications, not for performing tedious, easy tasks.\nIf it’s common for you to think that ‘’it would be nice to have a script for X, but the time it’ll take to write it isn’t worth it’’, then let’s think about it as a chemistry reaction:\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\nIf the barrier for writing shell scripts is high, then you’ll stay on the left side, spending high energy to perform tasks.\nHowever, if you have a catalyst, the equilibrium state will be on the right side. In other words, if it becomes cheaper or easier to write unit scripts, then you’ll spend less energy performing the tasks.\nThe following practices help me write shell scripts without a hiccup:\nUse set -euo pipefail. This way you won’t have tricky surprises such as using undefined variables or having failed intermediate commands.\n\n    \n\nNamespace your functions. Let’s understand why:\n\n    \n\nWhat is is_valid? We don’t even know where it comes from. If we search for it in the whole project there will be possibly multiple results. Had we namespaced our functions the story would be different.&nbsp;\nIf instead it was named as json::is_valid, we wouldn’t even need to go to its definition to understand it. But if we wanted to, it would be easy. Also, refactoring without an IDE is easy like this because there’s a single match so a search and replace will safely do the job.\n&nbsp;\nUsing docopt is a must-have, so that you don’t spend time parsing arguments:\n\n    \n    \n\n    With docopt, you don’t need to write parsers. Instead, you just write the script documentation\n\nDon’t throw away your scripts, even if they are simple. Instead, put them in a folder, document them and make them available to your disposal whenever you need. I never remember the command for spawning a new Android emulator, for example, but I can always remember how to type dot android emu start. In particular, I divide all my scripts into non-nested folders and make them callable by a dot command.\n$ $ANDROID_HOME/tools/emulator start     # is it like this?  \n$ $ANDROID_SDK/tools/emulator -avd nexus # maybe like this?  \n# checks StackOverflow, other references or simply...  \n$ dot android emu start                  # there you go!\n\nFinally, my biggest tip for bash is… don’t use bash.\nUse a language you feel comfortable with or that makes sense to your project.\nUse Python, Ruby or NodeJS.\nMisc\nUse a window manager. Seriously, the time saved by not resizing, moving, minimizing and maximizing windows is huge. Let’s see a simple demonstration of what it can do:\n\n    \n    \n\n    A demonstration showcasing bspwm\n\nFor Linux, i3wm and bspwm are some options; for OSX, chunkwm and spectacle; for Windows, bugn.\nHave a dotfiles repository on Github. This way, it’s easy to share your setup with your colleagues. But most importantly: all your setup becomes centralized and you’re always two commands away (or some minutes away) from having your ideal config:\ngit clone https://github.com/denisidoro/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles  \nbash ~/.dotfiles/scripts/environment/init\n\nUse consistent keybindings across applications. My memory is limited, so it’s nice to memorize commands only once and extend them to other usages. HJKL, for example, is reserved for directions in my setup: cursor position and buffer selection on text editors, window selection and resizing on my window manager, scrolling on Chrome, moving between folders on ranger, etc. By the way, sequential keybindings help a lot. I can never remember commands like cmd + option + shift + whatever, but commands that follow a pattern are pretty straightforward:\nFocus window left:   CapsLock + H  \nFocus window right:  CapsLock + L  \nResize window right: CapsLock + R, L  \nSwap window right:   CapsLock + S, L  \nWarp window right:   CapsLock + W, L\n\nNavigate through your shell history with ease. This becomes trivial with fzf:\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    fzf gives Ctrl+R&nbsp;steroids\n    \n\n    \n\n\nHave a clipboard manager. Have you ever tried to paste some text just to realize that you overrode the clipboard with something else then you have to go back to the original application to copy it again? Well, if a clipboard manager this problem is past!\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    With a clipboard manager you have at your fingertips all your recently copied&nbsp;content\n    \n\n    \n\n\nMaster whatever tools you use: terminal emulators, text editors, IDEs, OS, etc.\nSum up\nOf course all I talked about is low level stuff which will save you some minutes or at most a couple of hours at the end of the week. The highest benefits come from high level changes, which may save you entire days of work.\nThat’s very subjective, though. Maybe what saves you time the most is doing more whiteboards, or avoiding overgeneralizing code, or not checking your emails every single minute. It may even be purely soft skill-related, such as communicating beforehand to your peers what you’re doing. So keep an eye on this kind of optimization as well.\nBut what I really recommend is… excel at being lazy!\nIf you’re lazy, you’ll get uncomfortable with time-demanding processes and it will become natural to optimize your workflow.\n\n\n    This post first appeared on\n    Medium.\n\n\n","id":"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/tips-for-faster-development/","title":"Save 15min a day: tips for faster development"}},"docInfo":{"https://denisidoro.github.io/":{"body":38,"title":3},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/cli-templates/":{"body":391,"title":3},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/clojure-graalvm-shell-scripting/":{"body":282,"title":5},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/data-driven-programming/":{"body":605,"title":3},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/dictionaries-in-shell-scripts/":{"body":109,"title":4},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/golang-repl/":{"body":165,"title":4},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/grafana-personal-finance/":{"body":424,"title":5},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/microservice-splitting-code-refactoring/":{"body":543,"title":4},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/mind-maps/":{"body":369,"title":2},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/monolithic-apps-graph-apis/":{"body":599,"title":7},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/moving-from-medium/":{"body":38,"title":2},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/react-native-kotlinjs/":{"body":403,"title":8},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/spreadsheet-tsdb-finance/":{"body":742,"title":5},"https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/tips-for-faster-development/":{"body":1116,"title":6}},"length":15},"lang":"English"};
